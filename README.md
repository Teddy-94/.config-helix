# Teddys Helix config

Main changes:
- set my custom theme and true-color
- add cursorline and set scrolloff
- disable auto-pairs and auto-format
- which the insert cursor to a bar (not big block)
- enable soft wrap


Some mappings:
- esc to get out of multi cursor etc
- Ctrl-s to save, I love pressing Ctrl-s
- Alt+j and Alt+k to move lines up and down
- Yank, Paste, and Replace with system clipboard in normal and select mode.

Thats about it, all in just shy of 40 lines, including whitespace etc!
